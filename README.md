# GeneFinder
Mini Project 1: Gene Finder

This program takes a sequence of DNA as an input and outputs a list of the amino acids most likely to code for proteins.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local drive.
2. Run gene_finder.py to get the a list of amino acids for the provided data set (X73525.fa)
3. Take the printed data set and input it into [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) to find a list of likely proteins which the Amino Acid sequence codes for.
4. To run another data set, either replace the sequence in X73525.fa or create a new .fa file based on the same format
5. To change the data set to run, open gene_finder.py and scroll to the bottom. Change the file path to match your file.
