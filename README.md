# GeneFinder
Mini Project 1: Gene Finder

This program takes a sequence of DNA as an input and outputs a list of the amino acids most likely to code for proteins.

## Usage
To use this program, clone the repository to your local drive. Then input a dna sequence via running the gene_finder.py file with python.

You will get an output of amino acids, which you can input into [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) to find a list of likely proteins which the dna sequence codes for.
